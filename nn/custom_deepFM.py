DeepFM (Deep Factorization Machine) Implementation

This module implements the DeepFM architecture, which is a neural network model that
combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation systems with the flexibility
and learning capacity of deep neural networks. The primary purpose of this implementation
is to handle both high- and low-order feature interactions effectively within the same model.

Features:
- Factorization Machine Component: Handles second-order feature interactions.
- Deep Neural Network: Manages high-order interactions and nonlinear feature transformations.

The DeepFM model is widely used in various tasks such as CTR (Click Through Rate) prediction
and ranking tasks in recommendation systems, where capturing complex interactions between
features is crucial.

This implementation may contain modifications to the original design to suit specific
needs or to optimize performance for particular tasks.
